# Hello there!

I'm a Full-Stack Developer based in Porto, Portugal.
Lifelong learner pursuing a career in Product Development.

I'm interested in 3D, Photography, UI/UX and Programming.

This is the repository for my personal website. Currently, it's a simple website I did over a weekend to display my resume and education, as well as some useful links.

It's a way of exploring new technologies and I will use it in the future to showcase more experiments.

## Usage

To run it locally, simply clone the repository and use the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Run in production mode
npm run build && npm run start
```

## Plan

Head over to [What's left?](https://github.com/ivolimasilva/ivolimasilva.github.io/projects/2) to check what I intend to do with this website.
